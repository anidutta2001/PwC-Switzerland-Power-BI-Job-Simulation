I'm interested in learning how to create interactive dashboards with PowerBI that are aesthetically pleasing and enable me to quickly and efficiently extract insights from huge, complicated information.  I wish to hone my PowerBI data visualisation and analysis skills and get greater knowledge about automation and machine learning techniques. I also want to improve my design thinking and digital storytelling abilities so that I can communicate findings to clients and stakeholders more effectively.
